## BDD
-The Welcome to Delani Studio Welcome Text is on top of two buttons.
You be required to hover the mouse around the buttons to make them active and when clicked they wil take you to another part of the same page.
-The other feature is a mouse image just below the picture when hovered around it will become active.
name will be outputed only when you have provided the gender and your valid dates so you need to understand that the gender section is important.
-The Fun part is a column where there are a couple of funny gifs that can be expanded/revelaed when the button is clicked and hiden at the same time.
